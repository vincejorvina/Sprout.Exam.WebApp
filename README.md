Possible new features:

1. Salary (for regular), Day Rate (for contractual), Tax Deductions, etc. can be added into the database, in order to simplify the synchronization between the front-end and back-end. Currently the amounts are hardcoded on the source code, meaning changes would have to be done separately on the back-end and front-end if ever there is a change on the values. By putting them on the database instead, very little work would have to be done if the values were to be updated.
